# OCT Scan Classification
## Notes
PROJECT IS DONE FINISHING DOCUMENTATION and README   

Currently working on Confusion Matrix and Disease Descriptions

Exploratory Data Analysis included in Notebook Folder

## Project Description:
A convolutional neural network (CNN) built with pytorch to classify Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into four diagnoses:  
  
Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)  
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)   
Lipid and Protein Deposits (DRUSEN)  
Healthy Eyes (Normal)

Train: Data used to train the model  
Validation: Used to tune parameters  
Test: Used after training to evaluate performance  

## Disease Descriptions
Futher Research to be provided
### Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)
The abnormal growth of new blood vessels within the choroid. 

### Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)  
Diabetes symptom that causes swelling in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.   

### Lipid and Protein Deposits (DRUSEN)
Small, yellow deposits that accumulate under the retina in the macula.
